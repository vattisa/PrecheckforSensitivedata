The script you provided is a Bash script designed to be used as a pre-receive hook in a Git repository. Let's break down each part of the script:

#!/bin/bash
This line is called a shebang or hashbang. It indicates the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. In this case, it specifies that the script should be interpreted by the Bash shell (/bin/bash).

while read oldrev newrev refname; do
This line starts a while loop that reads input from Git. It reads three values from standard input:

oldrev: The SHA-1 hash of the commit before the push.
newrev: The SHA-1 hash of the commit after the push.
refname: The full name of the reference being updated (e.g., refs/heads/master).
for commit in $(git rev-list $oldrev..$newrev); do
Inside the while loop, there is a nested for loop that iterates over each commit in the push range ($oldrev..$newrev). It uses git rev-list to generate a list of commit hashes between the old and new revisions.

if git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r $commit | grep -q 'secret'; then
Within the inner loop, this line uses git diff-tree to compare the tree objects of the old and new revisions. It then uses grep to search for a pattern ('secret') in the names of files changed by the commit.

echo "Error: Commit $commit contains sensitive data."
If the grep command finds a match, this line prints an error message indicating that the commit contains sensitive data, along with the commit hash ($commit).

exit 1
This line exits the script with a non-zero status code (1), indicating failure. It rejects the push, preventing the sensitive commit from being added to the repository.

done
Ends the inner for loop.

done
Ends the outer while loop.

exit 0
If no sensitive data is found in any of the commits, this line exits the script with a zero status code (0), indicating success. It allows the push to proceed.

Overall, this script is designed to scan each commit in a push for files containing the string 'secret'. If any sensitive data is detected, it rejects the push, preventing the inclusion of sensitive information in the repository.








We define an array SENSITIVE_STRINGS that contains the sensitive strings we want to search for.
Inside the inner for loop, we iterate over each pattern in the array using ${SENSITIVE_STRINGS[@]}.
For each pattern, we use grep -q "$pattern" to search for the pattern in the names of files changed by the commit.
If any sensitive data is found, we print an error message indicating the commit hash and the sensitive pattern, and reject the push.
We exit the script with a zero status code (0) if no sensitive data is found, allowing the push to proceed.
